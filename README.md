## We seek to empower all by creating an app to teach basic self defense moves in response to common attacks.

We hope to even the playing field and allow everyone to be able to venture out of their comfort zones by creating a program that will help womxn to feel safe and confident. Using the Google Cloud AutoML API to train a model of self-defense move detection as well as a basic Python GUI for portability on any PC with a webcam, we built a program that prompts users to train their self defense instincts. 

Once started, the program will prompt the user with an attack type they could encounter, records their defensive action, and notifies them if if the action was successful. The user can pick their level of difficulty by adjusting the amount of time they are allowed to respond.
